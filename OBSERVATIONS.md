# Observations

Most observations can be verified in `index*.log` commited on corresponding date.

## 2022-11-15

### Note
The code in `index.js` was adopted:
- to include a command line option `--no-lenient`, allowing to modify the default `lenient: true` Comunica option given as the default in previous versions
- to include a command line option `--query`, allowing to select particular queries rather than going over all 48
- to include a command line option `--repeat`, allowing to repeat each query as many times as expected to be needed to show inconsistent results.

The dependencies were updated and reinstalled to use latest `"graphql-ld-comunica": "^1.2.2"`.

All tests were run using node version `lts/gallium -> v16.18.1`.

Previous logfiles were deleted, to reduce focus.

### Observations for lenient: true
With Comunica option `lenient: true`, the inconsistency resulting from source `https://ben.de-meester.org/` remains.

This can be seen in file `index-v16-18-1-lenient-some-repeat10.log`, generated by executing

`NODE_ENV=production node ./index.js --query 6 10 19 29 47 --repeat 10 --log verbose 2>&1 | tee index-v16-18-1-lenient-some-repeat10.log`

or in file with Comunica logging `index-v16-18-1-lenient-some-repeat10-logc-debug.log`, generated by executing

`NODE_ENV=production node ./index.js --query 6 10 19 29 47 --repeat 10 --log verbose --logc debug 2>&1 | tee index-v16-18-1-lenient-some-repeat10-logc-debug.log`.

Find inconsistencies by searching for the string `is not equal to`.

Note the random behaviour (inconsistencies not necessarily at the same query for the two logfiles).

Also note that in the second file, an inconsistency is always preceeded by a Comunica logging `ERROR: request to https://ben.de-meester.org/ failed, reason: socket hang up`.

### Observations for lenient: false
With Comunica option `lenient: false`, Comunica terminates by throwing a `socket hang up` error on one of the requests to `https://ben.de-meester.org/`.

This can be seen in file `index-v16-18-1-not-lenient-some-repeat10.log`, generated by executing

`NODE_ENV=production node ./index.js --no-lenient --query 6 10 19 29 47 --repeat 10 --log verbose 2>&1 | tee index-v16-18-1-not-lenient-some-repeat10.log`

or in file with Comunica logging `index-v16-18-1-not-lenient-some-repeat10-logc-debug.log`, generated by executing

`NODE_ENV=production node ./index.js --no-lenient --query 6 10 19 29 47 --repeat 10 --log verbose --logc debug 2>&1 | tee index-v16-18-1-not-lenient-some-repeat10-logc-debug.log`.


## 2020-05-06
Additional loggings with Comunica logging level debug, on request:
- index-logc-debug-1.log, index-logc-debug-2.log: two runs (giving different results), run with commandline `NODE_ENV=production node ./index.js --log verbose --logc debug 2>&1 | tee <logfile>.log`.
- index-logc-debug-3-not-lenient.log: third run with same commandline as above, but code modified to set Comunica's lenient option `false`.

Observations:
- (1) Following differences in output data between first and second run:
  - in first run, `"id": "https://ben.de-meester.org/#me"` is missing from the output of query 30/48.
  - in second run, `"id": "https://ben.de-meester.org/#me"` is missing from the output of query 10/48.
  - in second run, `"id": "https://hvdsomp.info/#i"` is missing from the output of query 47/48.
- (2) Multiple occurrences of `ERROR: socket hang up` in first and second run, not immediately correlated to the missing output given above.
- (3) One occurrence of `ERROR: connect ETIMEDOUT 68.65.123.238:443` in second run, during query 47/48.
- (4) Interesting stacktrace when app ends in third run (Comunica not in lenient mode):
  ```

## 2021-05-05
All previous observations were based on running this app with node v14.16.1.
Today, repeated with all latest node lts versions vxx.yy.z (xx = 10, 12, 14 and 16).
Saved each logging output separately in **index-vxx-yy-z.log** files.
See those log files for detailed differences.

### Overviews
Next overview diagrams were derived from the log files.

For interpretation, it is interesting to know (see also knows-query-data.js) that:
- Queries 1-38 ar for routes /education/master-thesis/{year}/{slug} (10 datasources)
- Query 46 is for route /education/master-theses (10 datasources, same as for queries 1-38)
- Query 47 is for route /teams (26 datasources)

#### Heap used

![heapUsed](heapUsedDifferentNodeVersions.jpg)

#### Query duration
![duration](durationDifferentNodeVersions.jpg)

### Conclusions
- (1) Heap usage differences per node version are very different, but the peak value is comparable (1300 vs 1500 MB roughly). Perhaps only due to different garbage collector behaviour...
- (2) Execution time differences per node version are neglectible.

## 2021-05-04
- (1) Calling v8.writeHeapSnapshot() after first query, results in premature node exit, even without error message. Last lines of (verbose) logging output:
  ```
  info: Memory usage after handling query 1/48: 
        rss 255.07 MB
        heapTotal 135.85 MB
        heapUsed 108.06 MB
        external 1.9 MB
        arrayBuffers 0.46 MB
  info: Started writing heap snapshot to file heap-1.heapsnapshot
  ```
- (2) Confirmation of all observations of 2021-04-29, even when adding `NODE_ENV=production` in front of the node command line.
  It is very remarkable that exactly the same queries have excessive execution times (> 230 seconds).
- (3) Differences in output data for 2 master theses: `contactPoint` concerning `https://ben.de-meester.org/#me` (compared with previously committed index.log)

## 2021-05-03
- (1) First commit today: remarkable difference with observations (2) and (3) of 2021-04-29:
  - Suddenly total duration now 167 seconds, no excessive individual query execution times!
- (2) Second commit today: observations (2) and (3) again in line with those of 2021-04-29.
  - Due to behaviour of datasources??? or network???

## 2021-04-29
- (1) Big memory usage (up to 1600 MB)
- (2) Runs slow (over 2000 seconds to fetch all KNoWS data)
  - Mind the individual query execution times. Following ones have excessive execution times (> 230 seconds), compared to others (a few seconds):
    5/48, 10/48, 15/48, 20/48, 25/48, 30/48, 35/48, 46/48
- (3) It takes about 4 minutes between final log message ("Ending app...") and node application exit
